SECRET API
==========

Holiday by MooresCloud provides a very fast UDP-based API to control its globes.  The packet format is very simple - just send 150 bytes of data, the RGB values for each of the globes.  Packets greater than 150 bytes will be rejected.

Named in honor of the fine folks at Secret Labs in Hobart.
